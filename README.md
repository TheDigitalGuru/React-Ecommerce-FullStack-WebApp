# React-Ecommerce-FullStack-WebApp

This is a React Eccomerce website I created that uses Strapi as the CMS and Stripe for processing payments.
Both use api calls to the front end and each other for seemless integration.

I will upload this site using GH-Pages soon to highlight it's composition min its entirely. 

This project was a 4 hour tutotial provided by Ed Roh, I was able to complete following on YouTube and can be found here:
